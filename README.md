# IoT Food Management

The main idea behind this project is to replace barcodes on products (mainly food) with QR codes. QR codes can store much more data than a barcode. 

In general practice barcodes store just the code and no other information about the product. This results in maintaining a database corresponding to the barcode on the product. Instead this project relies on the fact that barcodes are replaced by QR codes. In doing so the product is in itself now a database.

The unique product code, name, manufacturing date, expiration data, batch number and even more data can be stored. This negates the need for maintaining an extensive database for products. 

Even the user can know all the information about the product. All this information can be centralized and publicly accessible. Even a simple QR code phone scanner is enough to read the data.
